# fluent-plugin-key-picker, a plugin for [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org)

## Component

* KeyPickerFilter
* KeyPickerOutput

Take a record and pick only the keys you want to pass

## KeyPickerFilter

### wat?!

```
<filter test.**>
  type key_picker
  keys           foo, baz
</filter>
```

And you feed such a value into fluentd:

```
"test" => {
  "foo" => "a",
  "bar" => "b",
  "baz" => "c",
  "bah" => "e",
}
```

Then you'll get filtered tags/records like so:

```
"picked.test" => {
  "foo" => "a",
  "baz" => "c"
}
```

### Configuration

#### keys

`keys` should include the keys you want to pick.

## KeyPickerOutput

### wat?!

```
<match test.**>
  type key_picker
  keys           foo, baz
  add_tag_prefix picked.
</match>
```

And you feed such a value into fluentd:

```
"test" => {
  "foo" => "a",
  "bar" => "b",
  "baz" => "c",
  "bah" => "e",
}
```

Then you'll get re-emmited tags/records like so:

```
"picked.test" => {
  "foo" => "a",
  "baz" => "c"
}
```

### Configuration

#### keys

`keys` should include the keys you want to pick.
